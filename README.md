AS A Technology enthusiast I WANT to shop for and buy repaired/refurbished electronics SO THAT I can find tools I need at a reasonable price.

GIVEN a dashboard with a search input WHEN I search for an item THEN I am presented with various products that I can choose from to purchase WHEN I am not trying to purchase the products at the very moment, I can save them to my personal cart that is saved under my account and revisit it at my choosing.
